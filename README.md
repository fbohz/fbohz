I am a passionate software engineer and social entrepreneur. I am proud of my beginnings as a youth developer with inner-city kids then through education within the halls of congress and now in software engineering.

As a software engineer with a focus on React, Node.js and JavaScript, I've built a robust portfolio including a professional coffee cupping app. I've also built custom library projects in other languages such as [Ruby](https://rubygems.org/gems/coingecko) that have been used widely by the developer community.

As a social entrepreneur I have co-launched different projects in areas such as health (MomBox), sustainability (PowerToThePeople), specialty food through art ([ArtesanoSpirit](https://artesanospirit.com/)) and performing arts. Many of such ventures have been awarded in business competitions.
