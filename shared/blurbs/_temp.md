## SUMMARY

I am a passionate software engineer and social entrepreneur. I am proud of my beginnings as a youth developer with inner-city kids then through education within the halls of congress and now in software engineering.

As a software engineer with a focus on React, Node.js and JavaScript, I've built a robust portfolio including a professional coffee cupping app. I've also built custom library projects in other languages such as Ruby that have been widely used by the developer community.
