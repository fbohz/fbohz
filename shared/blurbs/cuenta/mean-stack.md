# The MEAN / MEARN Stack

Often we we are developing we applications we divide our app in different *layers*. On this article we'll talk what is the MEAN stack in the context of full-stack development. 

## What is Full-Stack Web Development

In the most basic sense, when we talk about web development we could divide our app into three layers.

1. **A presentation layer**. Concerned with how the information is transferred to the user. So we build our user interface usually HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
2. **The business logic layer**. More concerned with data validation and the dynamic generation of such data depending on user needs. Here usually technologies such as Node, Ruby, Python, Java or PHP stand out.
3. **The data-access layer**. This layer is our database and how we store and access our data. The business logic will interact with this layer which is conformed by databases just as PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

So often when we talk about a **full stack developer** we mean a software engineer that is knowledgeable about this three layers. Nowadays these three layers might be further abstracted as **frontend** vs. **backend** layers. So here with business/data-access as backend and the frontend mostly with the presentation logic.

## An Unifying Single Language

It is a reality that for you to become knowledgeable and an expert on PHP/Python along with JavaScript/HTML/CSS, can take a long time. So if we have different languages for the backend vs the frontend it might be that you will be focusing in one layer or the other.

With the introduction of Node in 2009, which allowed the execution of JavaScript outside of the web browser this changed. Developers started seeing the potential of achieving an unifying single language across all layers. Then with the advent of MongoDB and the Angular framework doing full stack development with JavaScript became possible.

## MEAN Explained

We already gave you a hint of what MEAN stands for and you probably already have a sense that it uses JavaScript across all layers. The technologies involved in the MEAN stack goes as follows.

- **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)**: This is our database. It uses JSON-like documents and schemas. With JavaScript you can interact easily with this structure. Often we use MongoDB in conjunction with **[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)** which is an NPM package that allows for straightforward data modeling. Mongoose more or less represents what Express is to Node.
- **[Express Framework](https://expressjs.com/)**: A modular server side framework built on top of Node.js. It makes setting up and deploying a server a breeze. Helps alleviate the callback issues often related to vanilla Node.js applications.
- **[Angular Framework](https://angular.io/)**: A presentation framework used to build interfaces. It uses TypeScript which is an extension of JavaScript. It allows for reusable and modular code with better application management. 
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: As we mentioned is a JavaScript runtime well suited for server side applications.

The main objetive of this stack is that you can get started fast with your web applications and deploy in no time. If you are familiar to Rails and Rails API backend applications, by using the convention above you might see how comparable and straightforward it is, but now with a single language!

## The MERN Trend

Nowadays you might see developers in LinkedIn and other platforms referring themselves as MERN developers. The main difference of MERN is that the R here can represent any other framework (not limited to Angular itself) for the presentation layer. 

This is because today you not only have the option of using Angular, there's also **[Vue](https://vuejs.org/)** and **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** that you can use to build your interfaces. So now more than ever you have more options in building your interface rather than sticking to Angular. That is why some say MEAN has been replaced by the MERN designation to allow for this freedom on the presentation/frontend layer.

## Conclusion

By using a single language across all development layers it means for many of us that are starting that becoming a full stack developer can be achieved faster. Also, by having a single language communication across teams becomes more straightforward. Even though an engineering team might be split between frontend and backend developers. There's less of a learning curve for a frontend developer to be trained and help with backend efforts and the opposite.
